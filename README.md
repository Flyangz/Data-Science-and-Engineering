# Data Science / Engineering 
---
This repository records parts of notes and codes that I wrote when I taught myself coding and data science / Engineering. It was divided into three parts: Data Science / Engineering, Programming and other IT techniques. Here is a brief directory:  

（这个库记录了我学习编程和数据科学时的部分笔记和代码。 这些内容分为三个部分：数据科学/工程，编程和其他IT技术。 下面是一个简短的目录）
